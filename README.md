Learning is a continous process and in field of security we need to stay up-to date with tools and newer exploits. Great Blog sites like PortSwigger Research Blogs, Pentester Blogs and so many security researchers are running there Blog sites for the same.
But the problem was that they use to get extinguish in my Emails list or I may call that I be so lazy that onces ignored is a forever ignored, also the problem that not all of them have RSS Feed which means if we have to be checking them manually then it's a process that gets boring too quickly because many Bloggers blog infrequently and only when they does finding something blah blah blah ...

This is how we came to this idea of HackerByte Telegram Bot and use it as a notifier for myself whenever a new Blog comes in on any of my favourite sites.
